# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deployment

This is a standard Next.js application and can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Next.js.

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

**Important:** Before deploying, make sure to add all the environment variables from your `.env.local` file to your Vercel project's settings. The application will not work without them. These include your Firebase credentials and any other API keys.

### Netlify

This project also includes a `netlify.toml` file for easy deployment to Netlify. As with Vercel, you will need to configure your environment variables in your Netlify site settings.
