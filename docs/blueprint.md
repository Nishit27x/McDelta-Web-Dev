## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, desaturated stone grey (#4A4A4A) to emulate a classic Minecraft bedrock environment.
- Background color: A lighter grey, (#D3D3D3), allows blocks of content and key functions to stand out while continuing the bedrock concept.
- Accent color: Use enchanted blue (#6495ED), for interactive elements and hover states. The secondary color is blood red (#8B0000), used sparingly for highlights (e.g., Lifesteal). These choices reference core aspects of the gameplay experience and theme.
- Headline font: 'Jokerman' (sans-serif) for the 'McDelta SMP' header, lending an immediate connection to Minecraft aesthetics. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for readability in descriptions, features, and feedback sections.
- Pixel-art icons and illustrations in a blocky Minecraft style for server features and optional elements.
- Modular and responsive layout with grid systems, suitable for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Clean HTML/CSS or Tailwind-friendly components to allow extension.
- Subtle animations on scroll and hover to improve UX, like highlighting server feature cards or fading in gallery images. Lazy loading is applied for images.
